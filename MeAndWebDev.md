**Me and Web Dev**

_Now that you've learned a bit about what to expect in the course and have seen some of the jobs in the Web Development Industry, where do you see yourself at the end of your 14-week journey?_

- _What about 6 months from now?_
- _or 1 year from now?_
- _Are you excited? Scared? Eager?_
- _What do you hope to accomplish?_

My aim is to be ready to obtain an internship or job at the end of this (5/6 month long) course in web development. I am currently enjoying the course (currently taught be Lois, though assisted by Jawann and Gerrit), which I find to be rather fast-moving, but at the same time manageable, with additional hours of out-of-class study. I am really excited to get better at coding, and eventually build things on my own, and even express myself through the code that I write and the programs I make.

- _Can you foresee potential roadblocks?_
- _What can be done to prevent or circumvent them?_
- _Is there something that I, as your instructor, can do to help you on the road to success?_

My greatest fear, and potential roadblock at this moment is not being able to keep up with the material being covered in the course. I also think that losing the 'fun' element of coding would be another roadblock for me (as I am really interested in digging deeper and being creative with this medium). I believe that my greatest defense against falling behind is putting a significant amount of effort into learning/reviewing the material on my own, which I am currently trying to do. I am grateful for the insights and help offered to me by Lois and the other teachers of this course, and feel that things are on the right track.
