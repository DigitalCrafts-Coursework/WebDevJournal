\*Me and Git/Github\*\*

_Now that you've learned a bit about Git and Github, reflect upon and answer the following questions._

- _What is the difference between Git and Github?_
- _Why use Git?_
- _Why use Github?_
- _What is the payoff to using Git and Github?_

In my view, Git is a version control application allowing for the creation of local repositories to store and track files on ones' own computer. These local repos can be linked to 'global repositories' hosted by Github, providing improved security (in case your computer is damaged), and the opportunity for collaboration. Beyond the reasons stated, I believe that the main 'reason' for using Git/Github is to be able to edit code (private or public) without the fear of causing real damage (i.e. there is always the opportunity to revert to an earlier commit, if some bug or more serious issue becomes unresolvable).
