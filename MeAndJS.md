**Me and JS**

_Now that you've learned a bit about Javascript, reflect upon and answer the following questions._

- _What are the primary uses for JavaScript?_
- _What are some positives to using JavaScript?_
- _What are some downsides to using JavaScript?_

I believe that Javascript is the most popular 'scripting' language running interactive websites on the internet. It provides these website with functionality, meaning that a user can interact with the website (whether it be through button clicks, an online form, media player, or game) rather than it being a static webpage. Javascript can also be run outside of the browser (using node.js) where it is used to interact with hardware (such as in robotics) and in the general internet of things.

While I do not have much personal experience with Javascript, I am under the impression that it is one of the easier programming languages to learn (like python). I have heard it called an expressive language, which I believe to mean, it is flexible in giving programmers several ways in which to execute a task, though I have also heard that this expressivity makes Javascript more 'wordy' than other languages (i.e. java). I can not really speak to any further downsides of using Javascript at the moment, but I hope to understand more about its syntax and utility in the future.
